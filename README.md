# NeuralNetworkControl
The code in this repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a feed-forward neural network used to control the angular position of a mechanical arm drivenby two pneumatic actuators called rubberators.
An in depth discussion of the techniques used to simulate the system can be found in ``ControlsFinalReport.pdf``.

Additionally a video of the working system can be seen in ``SystemSimulation.m4v``
